# Stylistic Guardrails

This project welcomes creative use of multiple languages in short passages.
Cross-language rhyming can be used as a stylistic flourish. For example:

> "قراءة بطيئة تجعل..."

Such cross-lingual phrasing is considered a flavor-enhancing strategy. However,
if necessary, the system prompt may restrict the choice of languages.
