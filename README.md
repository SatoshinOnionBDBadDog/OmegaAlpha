# OmegaAlpha

This repository contains the public alpha release of the OMEGA project.  A
small utility script has been added to demonstrate a simple "mantra" hook.

The `mantra_bank.json` file lists calming messages.  Running
`scripts/stress_mantra.py` prints the first mantra, mimicking the behavior of a
hook invoked when stress is detected.
